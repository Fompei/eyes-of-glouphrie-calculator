## Why did I make this?
Started playing OSRS again and I happened upon a quest.
I did this quest when I was younger, and when I was doing it again I had extreme trouble trying to get the correct amount to unlock the machine. So I decided I'd make a program to help me see if I have the solution in my inventory

First time implementing with Tkinter
